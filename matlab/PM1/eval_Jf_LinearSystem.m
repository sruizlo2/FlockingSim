function Jf = eval_Jf_linearSystem(x,p,u)
% evaluates the Jacobian of the vector field f(x,p,u) 
% at state vector x, and with vector of inputs u.
% p is a structure containing all model parameters
% i.e. in this case matrices p.A and p.B 
% corresponding to state space model dx/dt = p.A x + p. B u
% note that in thie case the Jacobian is trivially just p.A
%
% f = eval_Jf_linear(x,p,u)

Jf=p.A;
% notice this is a trivial implementation since
% the linearation of a linear function is the function itself.
% however it is still important to have a separate function for this Jacobian
% for consistency accross the code base since 
% evert eval_f should have its own eval_Jf including the trivial ones
